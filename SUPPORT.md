## ☕ Buy Me a Coffee

If QueryMind saves you time or makes your life easier, consider supporting development:

**https://buymeacoffee.com/rduffy**

Your support helps with:
- 🚀 Continued development and new features
- 🐛 Bug fixes and maintenance
- 📚 Documentation improvements
- ☁️ Infrastructure costs (servers, domains, etc.)

Even a single coffee ($5) makes a huge difference! 🙏

## 💼 Commercial Licensing (Coming Soon)

Inspired by [Obsidian's licensing model](https://help.obsidian.md/teams/license), we're working on an optional commercial license for companies that want to support the project and get priority support.

**For now**:
- ✅ Use QueryMind freely for personal or commercial projects
- ✅ No restrictions, no worries
- ✅ Support via Buy Me a Coffee if you'd like

**Future plans** (when ready):
- Optional paid support plans for enterprises
- Custom deployment assistance
- Priority bug fixes

But that's all "coming soon" - for now, it's 100% free!
